Bootswatch Themes ported to razorCMS

These themes are from **Bootswatch** and have been ported to run on **razorCMS**.

Check them out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).

You can check out **razorCMS** here [razorCMS](http://www.razorcms.co.uk/)

## Getting Started

Theme files are easiest to install by downloading through the Admin/Extensions interface in razorCMS.

## Bugs and Issues

## Creator

All themes were ported by [swamper](swamper838@gmail.com). My work follows the original razorCMS licensing.


## Copyright and License

**razorCMS** is licensed under the *GPL V3*; you can find a copy by [Clicking Here](//gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). So what does this mean? Well, you can do whatever the hell you would like with this software; create sites, extend it, change it, fork it; I don't really care either way.

All I ask is be kind, keep comments in place, and give a nod back to the guy that wrote it. If you purposely copy my code, and rebadge this software, I will point you out as a fraud, and will make sure everyone knows it too. It takes five seconds to show credit where it's due, and I have put more than five seconds into making this for you all to consume.

So you don't need to have a link in your site such as *Powered by xxxxxxxx*, or *This Site Uses xxxxxxx*. You make it look how you want it. Just donâ€™t pass my work off as yours.

On a side note to this, the **razorCMS** website is Copyrighted to smiffy6969 (me). You are not permitted to use that **Theme**, or copy anything within that site.
